## What is a blueprint?

At Stakater, we've taken the thousands of hours we spent building infrastructure on AWS and condensed all that experience and code into pre-built blueprints or packages or modules. Each blueprint is a battle-tested, best-practices definition of a piece of infrastructure, such as a VPC, ECS cluster, or an Auto Scaling Group. Modules are versioned using Semantic Versioning to allow Stakater clients to keep up to date with the latest infrastructure best practices in a systematic way.
